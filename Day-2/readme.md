# Python Numeric Data Types: int and float

## **Task**: Understand the numeric data types in Python: `int` and `float`.

### **Description**:
In Python, numbers are divided into two main numeric data types:
- **`int`**: Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without decimals.
- **`float`**: Represents real numbers, i.e., numbers with decimal points.

### **1. Integer (`int`)**:
An **integer** is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. It does not have any decimal point.

#### **Example**:
```python
# Integer example
x = 10
y = -5
print(x)  # Output: 10
print(y)  # Output: -5
```
### 2.Float(float):
A float is a number that has a decimal point. It can also be written using scientific notation (e.g., 1e3 for 1000).
```python
# Float example
a = 3.14
b = -0.5
c = 2.0
print(a)  # Output: 3.14
print(b)  # Output: -0.5
print(c)  # Output: 2.0

```
# SUMMARY:
int: Represents whole numbers without decimals.
float: Represents real numbers with decimals.
Both data types can be used in mathematical operations.
