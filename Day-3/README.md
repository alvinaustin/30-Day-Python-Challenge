# Day 3: Membership Operators and If Conditions

## **Task**: Use membership operators and if conditions in Python.

### **Description**:
Python provides **membership operators** to check if a value is present in a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple). The two operators are:
- `in`: Checks if a value is **in** the sequence.
- `not in`: Checks if a value is **not in** the sequence.

You can use these operators inside **if conditions** to make decisions based on whether a value exists in a sequence.

### **Examples**:

#### Example 1: `in` with a String
```python
word = "hello"
if 'h' in word:
    print("The letter 'h' is in the word.")
```

#### Example 2:'not in' string
```python
word = "hello"
if 'a' not in word:
    print("The letter 'a' is not in the word.")
```
